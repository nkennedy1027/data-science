    "When a function is called, the Python interpreter remembers which line of code called the function and knows to return back to it after the function's (implicit or explicit) return statement is reached.  Functions can also call other functions, so the interpreter will return to the call site of *those* functions once they're completed as well.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **call stack** is how Python remembers where to return the execution after each function call.  Python utilizes what's known as *frame objects* when you call a function.  Each time a function is called a new *frame object* is put on top of the call stack and the line number is stored.  As functions within functions are called, more *frame objects* are added to the *top* of the call stack.  Always the top.  And then the functions are completed from the top down.  A function that calls another function can't be completed until the newest function is completed.  \n",

    "While it isn't that important to understand this concept in-depth, it is useful for understanding *local* and *global scope*. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Local and Global Scope\n",
    "A *scope*  is essentially a container for variables, which only exist as long as their containing scope exist.  There are two types of scope: local and global.  First, the global scope.  There is only one global scope and it is created when your program begins and is destroyed when your program ends.  Variables created here are considered *global variables* and will disappear after the global scope is destroyed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you create a function on the global scope, a local scope is created.  Any variables created within functions are considered *local variables* (conversely, global variables are only those that are outside of any function).  As with the global scope, once the local scope is destroyed (aka the function is returned), all of its local variables are lost and will not be remembered the next time you call that function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some important things about scope: \n",
    "* Code in the global scope cannot access local variables\n",
    "* Code in local scopes can access global variables\n",
    "* Code in local scope cannot use variables from other local scopes (unless, I'm assuming, there are nested local scopes)\n",
    "* You can use the same name for variables if they are in different scopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The *global* Statement\n",
    "The last point had me wondering, because in JavaScript you can't repeat names in nested scopes (ie global and local).  Python allows it because of the *global* statement.  If you want to use a global variable in a local scope, you just have to precede it with the *global* keyword to let the interpreter know that you are referring to a global variable instead of a new local variable.

    "## Summary\n",
    "Functions are one of the most important tools at a programmer's disposal.  They are used to group code into logical groups that can be repeated as much as needed.  They are also versatile, as they can receive arguments, resulting in different return values or actions depending on the input provided.  This is a powerful feature that will allow for flexibility and complexity, while reducing the lines of code you will actually have to write.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Functions create their own scopes and, within those scopes, their own local variables.  These are distinct from global variables (found on the global scope) and can operate independently. This protects variables from being affected by code in different scopes and helps reduce the potential for bugs and errors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When there is potentially error-prone code, you can use *try* and *except* statements to tell the program what to do when there is an error.  Otherwise, when the interpreter encounters an error it shuts the whole program down.  These statements help make your program more resilient.  "

    "## Practice Questions\n",
    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "    - Functions are advantageous because they allow you to create blocks of reusable code.  This cuts down tremendously on repetition.  You can also pass data to a function and get some output in return, making functions usable in a variety of different scenarios.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. When does the code in a function execute: when the function is defined or when the function is called?\n",
    "    - A function executes when it is called\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "    - the *def* statement, which precedes the name of the function\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "    - A function itself is a named block of code that may or may not have parameters and a return statement.  A function call is a line of code that includes the name of the function followed by closed parentheses that may or may not include arguments. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "    - There is only one global scope in Python.  It is the highest level scope of a Python program.  There can be as many local scopes as you want.  They are encapsulating in functions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "    - Variables in a local scope are destroyed when the function call returns.  They exist only as long as the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is a return value? Can a return value be part of an expression?\n",
    "    - A return value is the value that a function evaluates to. A return value can be used in an expression since it evaluates down into one value. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "    - If a function doesn't have an explicit return statement, the Python interpreter automatically assigns it a None return statement\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "9. How can you force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable?\n",
    "    - By adding the *global* keyword followed by the variable name.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "    - It is the only value of the NoneType data type\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What does the import areallyourpetsnamederic statement do?\n",
    "    - This statement brings a module named 'areallyourpetsnamederic' into your program and allows you to use its functionality.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "12. If you had a function named bacon() in a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "    - by preceding the *bacon()* call with *spam.* like this: *spam.bacon()*\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "13. How can you prevent a program from crashing when it gets an error?\n",
    "    - To prevent a program from crashing due to an error, you can wrap the potentially error-prone code in a *try* statement.  Paired with an *except* statement, this allows you to decide how Python handles errors.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "14. What goes in the try clause? What goes in the except clause?\n",
    "    - The error prone code goes in the *try* clause and the code that decides how to handle the error goes in the *except* clause.\n",
