But the world is more complex than that and we don't usually want the computer to follow the instructions one after another because we have to allow for variations depending on the context.

    "## Flow Control Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "### *if* Statements\n",
    "The *if* statement is the most common flow control statement.  It takes one condition, and if true, its clause is executed, otherwise it is skipped. The whole statement consists of the following: \n",
    "1. The if keyword\n",

    "The *elif* statement provides an intermediate alternative to the *if* and *else* statements.  That is, it provides the opportunity to evaluate more conditions following the original *if* statement but before the *else* statement.  There can be as many *elif* statements as you want but they must always follow an *if* statement or another *elif* statement.  They are essentially the same as *if* statements and will only execute if their conditin is true, otherwise they'll be skipped.  The whole statement consists of the following: \n",

    "### *while* Loop Statements\n",
    "There are two types of loop statements in Python.  The first, for whatever reason, is the *while* loop statement.  A *while* loop takes a condition and will execute its clause over and over again until the condition evaluates to False.  There is an important implication here.  The condition must change to False at some point or else you will find yourself with an infinite loop.  Therefore while loops can be dangerous.  The whole statement consists of the following: \n",
    "1. The while keyword\n",
    "2. A condition (that is, an expression that evaluates to True or False)\n",
    "3. A colon\n",
    "4. Starting on the next line, an indented block of code (called the while clause)"
